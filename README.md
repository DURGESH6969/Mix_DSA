# MIX_DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms Warm-Up

## Introduction
Welcome to MIX_DSA, a repository designed to help beginners get started with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository serves as a warm-up before diving into more complex DSA concepts. Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your skills, MIX_DSA provides foundational knowledge and hands-on exercises to get you started on your DSA journey.

It contains the neccessary founding prerequisite programs in order to learn the concepts of DSA. Also it is kind of haphazard order and cluttered right now thus the name MIX_DSA , but as of now i am trying to reorganise it for better navigation. Neverthless I have tried to structured the code in a beginer friendly way with necessary comments and explaination wherever needed.
